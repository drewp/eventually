Molecular Structure Determination and the ACDC Computational and Data Grid

In this talk, I present an overview of our design and implementation
of the ACDC-Grid, an extensive, multi-institutional proof-of-concept
grid that I have implemented in New York State.  This includes efforts
in grid monitoring, predictive scheduling, grid-enabling application
templates, backfill detection and optimization, data repositories and
operations, dynamic and automated allocation of resources, and dynamic
firewall, to name a few.

Further, I will discuss the functionality of the ACDC-Grid that
enables a cost-effective and transparent solution to a critical
application that I have developed to solve a key problem in structural
biology.  This application (SnB) is used to determine molecular
structures from X-ray crystallographic data.  The grid-based
implementation includes grid-enabled optimization via data
repositories, data mining, and intelligent generation of jobs to be
run by the daemon overseeing the parameter optimization routine.

SnB is a computer program based on our Shake-and-Bake method of
molecular crystal structure determination.  It is the program of
choice for structure determination in many of the 500 laboratories
that have acquired it. This computationally-intensive procedure can
exploit the ACDC-Grid due to its ability to present the user with a
large computational infrastructure that will allow for the processing
of a large number of related molecular trial structures.

The SnB program uses a dual-space direct-methods procedure for
determining crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data. This
program has been used in a routine fashion to solve difficult atomic
resolution structures, containing as many as 1000 unique non-hydrogen
atoms, which could not be solved by traditional reciprocal-space
routines. Recently, the focus of the Shake-and-Bake research team has
been on the application of SnB to solve heavy-atom and anomalous
scattering substructures of much larger proteins provided that 3-4A
diffraction data can be measured. In fact, while traditional direct
methods had been successfully applied to substructures containing on
the order of a dozen selenium sites, SnB has been used to determine as
many as 180 selenium sites. Such solutions have led to the
determination of complete structures as large as 567 kDa.

The Shake-and-Bake procedure consists of generating structure
invariants and coordinates for random-atom trial structures. Each such
trial structure is subjected to a cyclical automated procedure that
includes computing a Fourier transform to determine phase values from
a proposed set of atoms (initially random), determining a
figure-of-merit, refining phases to locally optimize the
figure-of-merit, computing a Fourier transform to produce an electron
density map, and employing a peak-picking routine toexamine the map
and determine the maxima. These peaks are then considered to beatoms,
and the cyclical process is repeated for a predetermined (by the user)
number of cycles.

The running time of this procedure ranges from minutes on PCs to
months on supercomputers. Trial structures are continually and
simultaneously processed, with the final figure-of-merit values of
each structure stored in a file. The user can review a dynamic
histogram during the processing of the trials in order to determine
whether or not a solution is likely present in the set of completed
trial structures.

The Shake-and-Bake procedure was listed on the IEEE Poster ``Top
Algorithms of the [20th] Century'' and key components of the ACDC-Grid
have been incorporated into Grid3, Grid3+, and the Open Science Grid
(OSG), to name a few.
