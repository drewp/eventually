If faculty or staff in your department are likely to be on email during
the night of Saturday 6/11, you'll want to let them know about the
sporadic availability associated with a planned upgrade at that time.
>From approximately 10:00pm 6/11 until 8:00am 6/12, Exchange server data
will be moving from it's current storage hardware to new and improved
hardware.  The movement of data will be done in stages, such that a
given user may experience up to 2 hours without receiving new mail at
some point during the night.
